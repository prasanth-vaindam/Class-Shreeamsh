    <div class="class box3">COLUMBIA FALLS, ME– On Saturday, March 16, national nonprofit Wreaths Across America
        (WAA) will pay tribute to the
        American heroes who selflessly sacrificed their lives aboard Flying Tiger Line Flight 739 (FTLF 739). Join
        us for a
        special event at noon ET at the FTLF 739 Monument on the Balsam Valley tip lands in Downeast Maine. The
        event will be
        broadcast live on WAA’s official Facebook page and Wreaths Across America Radio.</div>

    <div>Sixty-two years ago, on March 16, 1962, FTLF 739 and its crew departed on a secret mission to Vietnam
        sanctioned by
        President Kennedy. This reconnaissance mission went missing, with no trace of the plane or its passengers
        ever found.
        Onboard were 93 United States Army soldiers, 11 civilian crewmembers, and four Vietnamese citizens. Very
        little is known
        about what happened to FTLF 739, its crew, and its passengers.</div>
    <br><br>
    <div>Due to the circumstances surrounding this mission, the names of those lost have never been added to the
        Vietnam Veterans
        Memorial in Washington D.C. Presently, a private citizen erected the only monument that bears the names of
        these
        American heroes, Wreaths Across America founder Morrill Worcester. The monument is located on his tip land
        in Maine,
        where balsam is harvested to make veterans’ wreaths that are placed each December as part of National
        Wreaths Across
        America Day – this year on Saturday, Dec. 14, 2024.</div>
    <br><br>
    The inscription on the FTLF 739 monument in Maine reads: “Missing in action; Presumed dead. Flying Tiger Line Flight
    739
    went missing on March 16, 1962, with 93 U.S. Army soldiers on board. These men and their flight crew perished in
    what
    would become one of the biggest aviation mysteries out of the Vietnam War era.”
    <br><br>
    This solemn ceremony will share poignant messages and stories about FTLF 739 and pay homage to the crew’s memory.
    Join
    us as we come together to remember and honor these selfless individuals and the enduring spirit of courage they
    exemplified.
