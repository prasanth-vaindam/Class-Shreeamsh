Problems with inline styles
internal styles using style tag
what is a selector
grouping of selectors

NOTE: if two rules are applied to the same element then the one which comes last will be applied

NOTE: Inline Styles will override Internal styles 
which means Inline Styles have higher priority

class and Id are global attributes, which means they can be applied on any tag or html element
they are used to select the elements (or) target the specific elements

In CSS rules for class selector are their will be a . in front of class name 
e.g. 
whereas for id slector we use # in front of the id name
