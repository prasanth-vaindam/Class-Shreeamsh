Flex Box

display:flex;
flex-direction: column-reverse;
flex-direction: items in the container are aligned
row - default
column - along the cross axis
to start from the flex-end - row reverese

flex-wrap: nowrap; default - they will be in the same line
 row-gap: 25px;
            column-gap: 10px;
            /* gap: 10px 20px; */

Doubt:
What is the difference between end and flex-end
start and flex-start

is their a way I can streh a item horizontal
